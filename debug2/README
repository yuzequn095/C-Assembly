Debug 2
--------
1.
 Effect: error: break statement not within loop or switch
 Line: 41 in debug2.c
 Before: while(turn); {
 After: while(turn) {
 Explain: We need to delete ';' to make loop works.

2.
 Effect: error: array type has incomplete element type
 Line: 19 in printBoard.c
 Before: void printBoard( long board[][] ){
 After: void printBoard( long board[][3] ){
 Explain: The second and subsequent dimensions must be given to make 
          2-dimension array argument function works correctly.

3.
 Effect: Print error information: "yIndex not a number\n" "xIndex not a
         number\n"
 Line: 49, 68 in parsePlay.c
 Before: pos = '\0';
 After: *pos = '\0';
 Explain: We need to change the value which pos pointer to rather than pos 
          itself.

4.
 Effect: Segment fault.
 Line: 59, 64 in checkMove.s
 Before: add    r0, r3, r3;   add    r3, r1, r3
 After: add     r0, r0, r3;   add     r3, r0, r1
 Explain: In the first part, we should update memory from borad(r0); in the 
          second part, we should update memory from what we got from part 1.

5.
 Effect: Invalid position error.
 Line: 71 in checkMove.s
 Before: Blank line.
 After: b       end
 Explain: We should set a b to jump over the invalid return if it is valid.

6.
 Effect: Can't turn player correctly.
 Line: 75 in debug2.c
 Before: turn = ((turn = 1) ? 2 : 1);
 After: turn = ((turn == 1) ? 2 : 1);
 Explain: We should check if turn is equal to 1 rather than let it be 1.

7.
 Effect: Incorrect valid position check.
 Line: 49, 55 in checkMove.s
 Before: bge     INVALID
 After: bgt     INVALID
 Explain: The index 2 should be valid.

8.
 Effect: Can't check win correctly.
 Line: 26, 27, 28 in checkWin.c
 Before: long xWinArray[3] = {0}; 
         long yWinArray[3] = {0}; 
	 long dWinArray[2] = {0};
 After: static long xWinArray[3] = {0};
        static long yWinArray[3] = {0};
	static long dWinArray[2] = {0};
 Explain: We need to set variable as static to let it retain value from 
          previous call.
